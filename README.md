The goal of this project was to create a seven-bit current-output digital to analog converter using
Xschem, Magic, and Skywater Technologyâ€™s SKY130 PDK. The output current must be available as
a current source or sink that changes by no more than 0.5%/V over at least 80% of the 1.8V power
supply range. The circuit simultion results must show that without mismatch, the worst-case DNL is
less than 2 LSBs and your INL is less than 4 LSBs and that, with mismatch, the worst-case INL and
DNL are both less than 8 LSBs
